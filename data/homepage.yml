    <p class="lead">
    With experience in designing <span class="bold-blue">machine learning models</span> and scraping/presenting large amounts of data, 
    I've developed a MLB Game Predictor website and the Mountain Hawk Food Finder iOS app. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Last summer, I trained mathematical models and agent-based models based on historical data obtained by the CDC.
    I also created <span class="bold-blue">powerful data visualizations</span> to provide actionable insights into mitigating influenza spread.
    My team's agent-based influenza modeling project came in <span class="bold-brown">second place</span> in the Lehigh Summer Research Day Expo.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of work, I spend time playing fantasy football, listening to music, and editing videos.
    I have played baseball since elementary school and like to play pick-up basketball with friends.
    I also enjoy participating in <span class="bold-blue">hackathons</span> and <span class="bold-brown">programming challenges</span>.

Last fall, I was involved with making pseudo <span class='bold-blue'>verkle trees</span> in Rust using the Marlin and ark_works cryptographic libraries. In creating the verkle tree, I worked on creating polynomial commitments, inserting nodes into the trie, and verifying proof of membership and non-membership."
