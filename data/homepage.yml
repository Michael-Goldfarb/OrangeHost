    <p class="lead">
    Hi there! I am a computer science and business student at <span class="bold-brown">Lehigh</span> who is focused on simplifying user interactions with technology,
    finding unaddressed niches, and delivering innovative solutions to users. I strive to be an <span class="bold-blue">early adopter</span> 
    of new technology so that I can deliver innovative products to users.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I have experience in machine learning, both in an industry and research setting. 
    I also enjoy building <span class="bold-brown">web applications</span> for my projects, clubs, and internships. 
    Recently, Iâ€™ve delved into <span class="bold-blue">Blockchain</span> and <span class="bold-brown">iOS development</span>.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Now, I'm excited to create <span class="bold-blue">user-friendly UX/UI experiences</span> and build secure, scalable backend systems.
    My commitment to staying current with industry trends drives my pursuit of professional growth. 
    I'm actively seeking opportunities to contribute my skills to innovative web development and software engineering projects.

    <p class="lead">
    With experience in designing <span class="bold-blue">machine learning models</span> and scraping/presenting large amounts of data, 
    I've developed a MLB Game Predictor website and the Mountain Hawk Food Finder iOS app. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Last summer, I trained mathematical models and agent-based models based on historical data obtained by the CDC.
    I also created <span class="bold-blue">powerful data visualizations</span> to provide actionable insights into mitigating influenza spread.
    My team's agent-based influenza modeling project came in <span class="bold-brown">second place</span> in the Lehigh Summer Research Day Expo.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    Outside of work, I spend time playing fantasy football, listening to music, and editing videos.
    I have played baseball since elementary school and like to play pick-up basketball with friends.
    I also enjoy participating in <span class="bold-blue">hackathons</span> and <span class="bold-brown">programming challenges</span>.

I research for the <a href='https://wordpress.lehigh.edu/blockchain/' target='_blank'><span class='bold-brown'>Lehigh Blockchain</span></a> group, where I currently am developing a Stellar-like <span class='bold-blue'>hierarchical consensus</span> mechanism to model a global cross-CBDC payment solution. Last fall, I was involved with making pseudo <span class='bold-blue'>verkle trees</span> in Rust using the Marlin and ark_works cryptographic libraries. In creating the verkle tree, I worked on creating polynomial commitments, inserting nodes into the trie, and verifying proof of membership and non-membership."
